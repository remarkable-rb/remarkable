# v3.1

* Allow validate_presence_of to work with associations [#63]

* Allow validate_uniqueness_of to work when scopes are not stringfiable values.
  You can now give timestamps, datetime, date and boolean as scopes [#60]

* Allow subjects to be overwriten quickly (quick subjects):

    describe Post
      should_validate_presente_of :title
 
      describe :published => true do
        should_validate_presence_of :published_at
      end
    end
 
  Is the same as:

    describe Post
      should_validate_presente_of :title
 
      describe "when published is true" do
        subject { Post.new(:published => true) }
        should_validate_presence_of :published_at
      end
    end

  And the string can be also localized using I18n [#57]

[COMPATIBILITY] validate_associated no longer accepts a block to confgure the
builder:

    should_validate_associated(:tasks){ |p| p.tasks.build(:captcha => 'i_am_a_robot') }

The right way to do this is by giving an option called builder and a proc:

    should_validate_associated :tasks, :builder => proc{ |p| p.tasks.build(:captcha => 'i_am_a_robot') }

* validate_uniqueness_of and accept_nested_attributes_for now use the new
  interpolation option {{sentence}} [#58]

* Added accept_nested_attributes_for matcher [#39]

* Added have_default_scope matcher [#38]

* Allow :conditions, :include, :joins, :limit, :offset, :order, :select, :readonly,
  :group, :having, :from, :lock as quick accessors to have_scope matcher

* Allow all kind of objects to be sent to have_scope (including datetimes, arrays,
  booleans and nil) (thanks to Szymon Nowak and Nolan Eakins) [#53]

* Added support to sql options in association_matcher: select, conditions, include,
  group, having, order, limit and offset, plus finder_sql and counter_sql. [#48]

* :source and :source_type are now supported by association matcher [#47]

* validate_inclusion_of became smarter since it now tests invalid values too [#36]

* Fixed three bugs in validate_uniqueness_of matcher [#42] [#40] [#37]

# v3.0

* Added more options to associations matcher. Previously it was handling just
:dependent and :through options. Now it deals with:

  :through, :class_name, :foreign_key, :dependent, :join_table, :uniq,
  :readonly, :validate, :autosave, :counter_cache, :polymorphic

And they are much smarter! In :join_table and :through cases, they also test if
the table exists or not. :counter_cache and :foreign_key also checks if the
column exists or not.

[COMPATIBILITY] Removed callback, have_instance_method and have_class_method
matchers. They don't lead to a good TDD since you should test they behavior
and not wether they exist or not.

[COMPATIBILITY] ActiveRecord matches does not pick the instance variable from
the spec environment. So we should target only rspec versions that supports
subjects (>= 1.1.12).

Previously, when we are doing this:

   describe Product
     before(:each){ @product = Product.new(:tangible => true) }
     should_validate_presence_of :size
   end

It was validating the @product instance variable. However this might be not
clear. The right way to do that (with subjects) is:

   describe Product
     subject{ Product.new(:tangible => true) }
     should_validate_presence_of :size
   end

Is also valid to remember that previous versions of Remarkable were overriding
subject definitions on rspec. This was also fixed.

# v2.x

* Added associations, allow_mass_assignment, allow_values_for, have_column,
have_index, have_scope, have_readonly_attributes, validate_acceptance_of,
validate_associated, validate_confirmation_of, validate_exclusion_of,
validate_inclusion_of, validate_length_of, validate_numericality_of,
validate_presence_of and validate_uniqueness_of matchers.
